    <description>Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a Ph.D. seeking student at Purdue University in Nuclear Engineering.  This portfolio shows some designs, publications, and open source codes that I&#39;ve created. Feel free to email me if you have any ideas, questions, or requests.

        <title>Fast ADC with a Beaglebone Black</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Code (software and firmware) at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/alexhagen/fast_adc_yun&quot;&gt;github.com/alexhagen/fast_adc_yun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve created a fast analog to digital conversion system using only an Arduino
Yun (and an external computer to process data).  The system can sample the
Arduino Yun’s ADC at 8-bit at greater than 30 kSps and then send those samples
out via UDP at the same rate.  With a fast enough external computer (most modern
computers would be), you can then catch most of those samples without error and
plot them, or log them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Multiphysics Modeling in Optimization of Acoustically Tensioned Metastable Fluid Neutron Detectors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My Master’s Thesis was published in August of 2014 after defending the thesis to a committee of &lt;em&gt;Purdue Nuclear Engineering&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Purdue Health Physics&lt;/em&gt; faculty members in May of 2014.  The thesis includes business confidential material and will not be published until 2016.  I will post the full text at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Characterization and Optimization of a Tensioned Metastable Fluid Nuclear Particle Sensor Using Laser Based Profilimetry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to give a talk and poster at the 22nd &lt;em&gt;International Conference on Nuclear Engineering&lt;/em&gt; (ICONE) in Prague. The poster that accompanied this talk and paper was selected as a Winner in the student competition.  I have submitted a revised version of this paper for publication in a new ASME journal, &lt;em&gt;Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>High Efficiency Gamma-Beta Blind Alpha Spectrometry for Nuclear Energy Applications</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My colleague and I wrote this paper for the International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, winning the Student paper competition with it.  A revised copy has been submitted for review to be published in ASME’s &lt;em&gt;Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science&lt;/em&gt; inaugural issue.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Utilization of Tension Metastable Fluid Detectors in Health Physics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Kevin Fischer, and I were invited by our lab’s consultants to present our technology at the Health Physics Society Conference.  This is somewhat out of field for us, and was used as a scoping mechanism to the interest in our technology in that field, with good results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Real-Time Monitoring of Actinides in Chemical Nuclear Fuel Processing Plants</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our technology has been tagged as a great hope in the characterization of actinide streams during separation.  This invited article was written by my Principle Investigator with its key components coming from my colleague and I’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
