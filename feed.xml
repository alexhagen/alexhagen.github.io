    <description>Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a Ph.D. seeking student at Purdue University in Nuclear Engineering.  This portfolio shows some designs, publications, and open source codes that I've created. Feel free to email me if you have any ideas, questions, or requests.

        <title>ANS Winter Meeting 2016 Awards</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In late December, I received in the mail the American Nuclear Society’s Young
Members’ Group Best Paper award for my presentation and accompanying paper at
the 2016 ANS Winter Conference.  Professor Taleyarkhan, the corresponding
author, also received word that the paper had won the overall conference’s Best
Paper Award.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
      Recognition of our award from Purdue's School of Nuclear Engineering
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an honor to receive, and it’s garnered some attention from Purdue’s
School of Engineering.  It’s always nice to get that kind of recognition.
Because I can’t publish the paper or the presentation here (for copyright and
intellectual property reasons), I’ve written a quick summary of the paper and
included some of the most salient figures below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;threshold-energy-based-active-special-nuclear-material-interrogation&quot;&gt;Threshold Energy Based Active Special Nuclear Material Interrogation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Hagen, Brian Archambault, Ph.D., and Rusi Taleyarkhan, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counter terrorism is an important and ever-present concern of our times.  CBRN
defense is a common acronym to describe the wide ranging terrorism concerns,
standing for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear.  Particularly, we
are concerned with Nuclear defense - the ability to detect and interdict those
materials that can create nuclear weapons if they are being smuggled.  These
materials (weapons grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium) are called
Special Nuclear Materials - or SNM.  If you’re interested in a more in depth
description of this motivation, I’ll put up a post soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we know that there is a weakness in our detection of SNM.  The
Congress of the United States’ Budget Office sums it up this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The passive radiation detectors outside shipping containers can usually
detect emissions from materials for radiological weapons but are less effective
at detecting emissions from nuclear weapons and the fissile materials used to
make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented a way to remedy this.  Our detectors, Metastable Fluid Detectors,
are more efficient than other neutron detectors, and have higher signal to
noise ratios than conventional neutron detectors because they are inherently
blind to $\gamma$ particles.  I’ll post a more in depth description of our
detectors soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of our detector makes it easily detect smuggled WGP.  However,
highly enriched uranium is much “quieter”, it emits less neutrons from
spontaneous fission.  To remedy this, we propose a method using &lt;strong&gt;active
interrogation&lt;/strong&gt;.  We direct a $2.45 MeV$ beam of neutrons onto the cargo, and
the fissile material (the HEU) will generate neutrons from induced fission.
Then, setting a lower level discriminator, we can detect only those fission
neutrons with energies above $2.45 MeV$, thereby not detecting any of the
interrogating neutrons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
      Ratio of fission spectrum above the interrogation spectrum.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this methodology, which we call &lt;strong&gt;Threshold Energy Neutron Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, we
were able to get ratios between the fission neutrons and interrogation neutrons
of over $1000 \times$.  This is much much larger than that achievable with
conventional neutron detectors, which we tested to ratios of only $12 \times$,
and the literature shows similar, or worse results.  In all, this is an
interesting and useful way to interrogate cargo for special nuclear materials.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IEEE Sensors 2016 First Place Demo Award</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In early November, we received the 1st Place Demo award from the IEEE Sensors
conference, which we had presented at just several weeks before.  It’s great to
get recognition, and my contribution to this award was sizeable.  I had
designed and prototyped the DC powered CTMFD unit that we took down to the
conference, and wrote the Android App used to control it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we are proud of the recognition, and usually I like to write up what
we actually presented on.  However, at this conference, the conference
generated a video primer of our demonstration, and I’ve embedded that below.  I
think it shows more fluently what we like to show than simply writing it up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Threshold Rejection Mode Active Interrogation of SNMs Using Continuous Beam DD Neutrons with Centrifugal and Acoustic Tensioned Metastable Fluid Detectors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Brian, Professor Taleyarkhan, and I - in collaboration with our colleagues from
Kyoto and Pony Industries - show the proof of concept for &lt;strong&gt;Threshold Energy
Neutron Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; using our tensioned mestable fluid detectors.  We also
discuss our minimum detectable quantity of special nuclear material with this
methodology, and the number is significantly smaller (better) than the current
state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Multiphysics Modeling in Optimization of Acoustically Tensioned Metastable Fluid Neutron Detectors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My Master’s Thesis was published in August of 2014 after defending the thesis to a committee of &lt;em&gt;Purdue Nuclear Engineering&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Purdue Health Physics&lt;/em&gt; faculty members in May of 2014.  The thesis includes business confidential material and will not be published until 2016.  I will post the full text at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Characterization and Optimization of a Tensioned Metastable Fluid Nuclear Particle Sensor Using Laser Based Profilimetry</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to give a talk and poster at the 22nd &lt;em&gt;International Conference on Nuclear Engineering&lt;/em&gt; (ICONE) in Prague. The poster that accompanied this talk and paper was selected as a Winner in the student competition.  I have submitted a revised version of this paper for publication in a new ASME journal, &lt;em&gt;Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Utilization of Tension Metastable Fluid Detectors in Health Physics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Kevin Fischer, and I were invited by our lab’s consultants to present our technology at the Health Physics Society Conference.  This is somewhat out of field for us, and was used as a scoping mechanism to the interest in our technology in that field, with good results.&lt;/p&gt;
