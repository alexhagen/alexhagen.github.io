  Throughout the years, I've ended up writing thousands of lines of code as
  support for classes or projects or research.  A couple years ago, I had the
  epiphany that if I saved all of the helper functions and reused snippets, and
  put in the effort to package them and document them, I would save time, and
  maybe others could use them.  There are a couple limitations to this plan,
  since I can't publish anything "novel" or "protected" (basically if Purdue
  thinks it owns the intellectual property, it does), but other than that, I'm
  trying to open source everything.  The codes fall under a couple categories:


  - **Firmware helper classes:**  Usually written in `c++`, these classes are
    transparent wrappers to more complicated `c` and `c++` routines that help
    in my mechatronics projects.
  - **Python data analysis and visualization classes:** To publish, you need to
    make a lot of figures and do a lot of analysis, and I've saved the
    non-specific ones of those to these libraries

  I'm providing all of these with no license whatsoever, so have fun coding!
