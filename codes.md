  Throughout the years, I've ended up writing thousands of lines of code as
  support for classes or projects or research.  A couple years ago, I had the
  epiphany that if I saved all of the helper functions and reused snippets, and
  put in the effort to package them and document them, I would save time, and
  maybe others could use them.  There are a couple limitations to this plan,
  since I can't publish anything "novel" or "protected" (basically if Purdue
  thinks it owns the intellectual property, it does), but other than that, I'm
  trying to open source everything.  The codes fall under a couple categories:


  - **Firmware helper classes:**  Usually written in `c++`, these classes are
    transparent wrappers to more complicated `c` and `c++` routines that help
    in my mechatronics projects.
  - **Python data analysis and visualization classes:** To publish, you need to
    make a lot of figures and do a lot of analysis, and I've saved the
    non-specific ones of those to these libraries
  - **Challenge/class project programs:** Most classes that have a final project
    are good ways to show off your skills, so I'll be cleaning up some of these
    (such as finite element codes, or point kinetics) to display on this page.

  I'm providing all of these with no license whatsoever, so have fun coding!
