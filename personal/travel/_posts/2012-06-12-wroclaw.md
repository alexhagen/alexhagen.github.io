# Wroclaw

After an absolute debacle in a small German border town, we finally caught our train to Wroclaw (and found out we’ve been pronouncing it WAY wrong – its VROTS-clov, not ROW-claw). After a three hour trainride with some Irish fans picking our brains about our thoughts on football, we made it to Wroclaw and checked into our hostel. Immediately, we had to leave for the stadium to watch the game, and were surrounded by Czech fans (the game was Czech Republic vs. Greece, and CR is only about 50 miles from the stadium). The Czechs started out the game well, going 2-0 up in the first 10 minutes, but the Greeks brought back one goal in the second half. Overall, the atmosphere of the game was hair-raising. After the end of the game, we went to downtown Wroclaw to watch the Poland-Russia game on big screens in the town square. There were about six screens with at least a thousand fans at each, and even though that game ended in a tie, we left the square chanting “Polska Bialoczerwoni!”.
