# Dachau

Today was a grey and somber day for us, as we decided to visit Dachau.  Not only was the weather oppressing (rained all day), but the site itself is poignant in a way that really can send chills through you.  The one repreive from the grey misery that is the concentration camp block is a small wooded alcove, full of natural Bavarian wildlife.  Just as we started to say that we were happy for the small amount of beauty, we read a plaque that showed that that alcove was the firing range for execution.  After Dachau, we got back to Munich and tried to see BMW World and the Olympic Stadium, then the Allianz Arena, but the rain wasn’t the best for sight seeing.  Finally, we got a couple beers at the Hofbrauhaus to get our minds off of what we saw at Dachau.
