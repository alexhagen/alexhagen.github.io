# Amsterdam

Last night we got into Amsterdam around 6 pm and were able to do some sightseeing before resting up for our trip to Berlin at 8 am today.  Although Amsterdam is known as a huge party city and also just a large city, it honestly felt like a small town (close to Cesky Krumlov) and we were able to walk the whole town.  The sightseeing was decent, as it is the home to Rembrandt and also hosts many museums and the Anne Frank house.
