# Berlin

Berlin got us back to more sightseeing ways, as we had several days in it.  Most of Berlin (80%) was bombed out in the war, so all of the sights to be seen were from the Cold War and the era of the Berlin Wall, or restored sights from the pre-war eras.  We also were able to watch the England-France game on a huge screen right in front of the Brandenburg Gate (although there were less fans there than I expected there would be).
