# Cesky Krumlov

Despite still not having our bags, we’ve soldiered on to a small town in the Czech countryside.  Apparently this town is both a huge tourist destination, and haunted.  The hostel room we’re staying in has several ghost stories attached to it.  Besides the hostel, the town has a castle, several beautiful churches, and a river (that we’re rafting through tomorrow).  Below are some pictures from Andrew’s iPhone:
