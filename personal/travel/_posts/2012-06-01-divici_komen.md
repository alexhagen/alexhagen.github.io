To end the night after getting to Cesky Krumlov last night, we decided to walk
the city’s castle and walk through town (which included grabbing some food in a
restaurant in the city’s catacombs).  Then, after another day of not getting our
luggage (but supposedly its being delivered to our hostel as we speak), we
decided to go with a newly made friend to a small castle (Divci Komon) about
half an hour north of Cesky Krumlov.  Apparently nobody has heard of this
castle, as we were the only people there.  In fact, after taking the train
north, we had to hike for several kilometers through the Czech wilderness to
find the ruins of this castle.  Pictures of this are below.  We’re going to a
gypsy music bar tonight to listen to some authentic gypsy music!
