# Our Europe Itenerary

We fly into Prague, and from there we’ll go to Cesky Krumlov (a small town in
the Czech country side for rafting).  Then we’ll go into Austria to hit Vienna
and maybe Salzburg.  To Munich after that, and Stuttgart if time permits, and
then to Paris, Brugge, and Amsterdam.  Finally we’ll come back to Berlin until
we need to leave for the game (Greece vs. Czech Republic) in Wroclaw, Poland.
From Poland, we’ll either stay for some tournament games, or head back early to
Dresden and Prague (where we fly out of).
