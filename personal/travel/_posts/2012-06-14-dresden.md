# Dresden

Not being keen on staying in Poland too long (Wroclaw was the dirtiest city we’ve been to yet), we caught a train back to Germany yesterday morning – not before we had a lunch of perogis and paczis though.  The train took us to Dresden, a reasonably sized German city near the Polish border.  It is famous for the firebombing which took place here in 1945 (subject of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five). The city itself has been rebuilt several times, but until recently parts of the city were still in ruins from WWII.  After talking to the receptionist at our hostel, she explained that memorializing the bombing was difficult for the city, as they didn’t want to ever claim being victimized since the Nazis had acted the way they did.  Most notably, the Frauenkirchen (Church of Our Lady) had lain in ruins until several years ago, but now is rebuilt in its original majesty.  Dresden also has a great “skyline” of old towers and churches.  We were able to watch a game on a large screen with at least 1000 Germans while looking over this skyline.  Luckily, the Germans won and the town celebrated all night.  Tomorrow, we leave for Prague, which is our last stop before home!
