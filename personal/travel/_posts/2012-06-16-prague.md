# Prague

We got to Prague last night and were able to go on a river cruise for the night before experiencing the admittedly strange Prague night life. Then, we woke up this morning and rented some bikes to get around the city easier.  We made our way to the Prasky Hradcova (Prague Castle), which was incredible, on the hill above the city.  The detailing of this building is amazing.  Coming down from the hill, we made our way through the Prague Bridge and into Old Town Square, which has the Astronomical Clock.  Just below the Astronomical Clock is a memorial to Jan Pollock, a protester to the communist re-invasion after the Prague Spring.  We finally went to the Winceslas Square (like the Christmas song), and biked back to our hostel.  Tonight we went to the Czech Republic game in Old Town Square, and saw the Czech Republic advance to the quarter-finals of the Euro.  Tomorrow we fly home!  I’ll be posting two more posts, one to wrap up the trip and show the best highlights, the other to show some interesting representations of America we saw abroad.
