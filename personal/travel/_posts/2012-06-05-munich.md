# Munich

Today was a much brighter day than yesterday, both weatherwise and what Andrew and I did.  We sightsaw downtown, which included the Frauenkirchen, the Rathaus, and a lot of shopping.  The Frauenkirchen is the great church in Munich, but is mostly covered in construction at the time.  The story of the chruch is that the architect promised the devil that he would build it with no windows, and when the devil came to inspect, the architect tricked him into standing in a place where no windows could be seen.  When the devil learned he was tricked, he stamped his foot and left a mark.  The Rathaus is the old city hall of Munich (and all of Bavaria).  We ended up the night with an adventure through several beer gardens.  Tomorrow we head to Paris!  I can’t believe it’s already been a week.
