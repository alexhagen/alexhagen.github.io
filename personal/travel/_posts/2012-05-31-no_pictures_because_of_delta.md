# No Pictures (for now) Because of Delta

After having our flight cancelled from IND to NYK, we had to scramble to get to
Prague.  A flight to Boston, Paris, running through the airport to catch our
flight to Prague, and then finally a two hour ordeal on the Prague subway, we
find that Delta has lost our bags. Somehow our bags that were supposed to
either be in IND, BOS, or Paris are in Amsterdam.  Well anyways, we went to the
Czech bierfest for last night so we could get our minds off being extremely
dirty, and this morning we’re headed to the Czech countryside for some mountain
biking, some rafting, and apparently good nightlife.  I can’t wait to put on
new clothes and properly shower. But for now, no pictures!
