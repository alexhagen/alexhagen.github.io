<p>Despite still not having our bags, we’ve soldiered on to a small town in the
Czech countryside.  Apparently this town is both a huge tourist destination,
and haunted.  The hostel room we’re staying in has several ghost stories
attached to it.  Besides the hostel, the town has a castle, several
beautiful churches, and a river (that we’re rafting through tomorrow).<br />
Below are some pictures from Andrew’s iPhone:</p>
