<p>Today we got on the coach to go from Vienna to Munich.  This included a stop in
Gruneau and Salzburg, and not much noteworthy happened.  In Gruneau we were fed
an incredible meal of lasagne, and were able to drink out of a stream that was
so clear it was incredible.  Upon arrival to Munich, even a jog through the old
town square, and a visit to a beer garden couldn’t stop us both from commenting
on how dystopian the city feels.  Hopefully tomorrow will perk up (although the
forecast of 100% rain certainly doesn’t help).</p>
