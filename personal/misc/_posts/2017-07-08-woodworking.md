One thing I've noticed about myself is that I feel better when I *make* things.
Whether it's building something small at home, designing and having something
at work fabricated, or even if it's organizing and creating the branding for a
team I play on, or a group I'm involved with, I like the process of design and
creation.  In that vein, I've been passively interested in woodworking for
quite a while - in the watch-a-million-videos-on-youtube kind of way.

Unfortunately, woodworking requires a lot of equipment to do correctly. And
doing it incorrectly seems like you just end up making a lot of garbage.  So,
to be budget friendly, I've decided on a long term scheme for how to develop a
fully featured shop.  This may all be moot, though, because my move in a couple
months may have me move to somewhere that has fully featured makerspaces that I
can just get a monthly subscription to.

My plan basically revolves around carefully planning projects, and then
purchasing the equipment required for each project, in order of least to most
equipment.  Then, to replicate each project multiple times, and sell it on
Etsy.  I plan to sell as many on Etsy as is needed to pay for the equipment
that I bought for the project.  Hopefully they sell!

Right now I have a couple projects that I want to do:

- A console/mount station for all-of-the-electronics including enough power to charge everything and a usb-to-wifi hub, even if I have to write the drivers myself.
  - Tools required: I think just a plunge router.  Maybe a belt sander.
- A step stool for our kitchen.
  - Tools required: I think a table saw.
- A dining room table for our kitchen.
  - Tools required: Jointer, Planer, maybe a biscuit joiner.  And definitely a belt sander if I don't have one from before.
- A bed.
  - I think I'll have everything from before.
- A mounted projector box for our patio.
  - I think I'll have everything from before.

So my current *modus operandi* is to design everything in CAD before I make
these.  I usually use Solidworks, but I think for the whole legal aspect (and
the use-on-something-other-than-windows aspect) I should learn Fusion-360 for
my first project and use it from there.  I'll update as I go along!
