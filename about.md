Hi, I'm Alex.  I've set up this website for a couple reasons.
One is to present my work in a way that possible employers can look through it.  I think that's the least important reason though.  
I also wanted a place to host materials that I've created through teaching and preparing for classes, because I think these materials will help out others trying to learn the same concepts I was.
I've also hooked in a lot of services that help quantify what I'm doing and what I've done.  I think this is good because it keeps me honest and allows me to make data-driven decisions on where to go with my work.  It isn't required that those metrics be public, but in this case, having them public makes for a compelling case for some employers.
Finally, I've made this website because I believe in open-source.  Although I'm shackled by the current academic system in many ways, I've tried to make the possible components of my work open-source.  You can find this in the codes that I've published, and also in my attempt to present my full work without keeping it behind a paywall.
So, in general, I hope this portfolio can be useful to you, whether you're a prospective employer for me, or need some help with nuclear engineering concepts, or if you need a snippet or library.
