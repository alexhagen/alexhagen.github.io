  Even with all of the different categories provided, there are some stray
  projects and thoughts that I'd like to have publicly available, so I'll keep
  those here.  In general, I'll separate them into projects - for stuff that I
  think people could benefit from, such as electronics projects, work updates -
  where I'll discuss things happening in my career and even editorialize about
  academia or industry, and reviews - where I'll review the scientific
  literature about interesting topics.
