Brian, Professor Taleyarkhan, and I - in collaboration with our colleagues from
Kyoto and Pony Industries - show the proof of concept for **Threshold Energy
Neutron Analysis** using our tensioned mestable fluid detectors.  We also
discuss our minimum detectable quantity of special nuclear material with this
methodology, and the number is significantly smaller (better) than the current
state of the art.
