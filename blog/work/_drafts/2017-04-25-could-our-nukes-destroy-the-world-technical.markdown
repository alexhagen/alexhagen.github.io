*I became really interested in writing an article about humans' actual
capacity for destruction given the current amount of nuclear weapons during
a conversation with a close friend.  Obviously tied to my research, the
question also plays on the topical fears about our current president's
power, and the recent actions of a certain grumpy northern brother to South
Korea.  I'm writing two articles, the current one <b>The Data Science Behind
"Could Our Nukes Destroy the World?"</b> and the main article <b>"Could Our
Nukes Destroy the World?"</b>, in the order they're listed above.  Obviously,
this is a bit backwards. I hope it the article set gives you some perspective,
or at least is interesting.*
