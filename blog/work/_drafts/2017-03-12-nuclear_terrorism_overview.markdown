*Disclaimer: This topic is a difficult one to discuss.  First, by sharing
information about what's being done to stop terrorism, you inevitably give
information about what can be done to defeat those countermeasures.  Second,
you have a walk a fine line between motivating the public that we need
counter-terrorism, and avoiding fear-mongering.  Accordingly, I've summarized
the "Motivation" section of my dissertation below.  I've tried to stick to
already published facts, and obfuscated anything too specific.  I've also
decided my own line for the tightrope between fear-mongering and appropriate
motivation. I hope it's informative or useful to you.*
