*This is my essay for an application to the Nuclear Engineering Student
 Delegation, a student delegation (obviously) that goes to DC once a year to
 lobby for nuclear engineering education.  The prompt for the essay is "The
 Delegation is committed to advocating for Nuclear Science and Technology
 students to ensure a sustainable nuclear workforce and infrastructure. Write
 a short policy statement focused on the importance of federal funding for
 education to meet this demand."  I thought it would be interesting to put
 this up for you guys to read, because it's an interesting topic.*
