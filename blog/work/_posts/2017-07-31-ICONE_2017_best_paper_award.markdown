In July, one of my coworkers and coauthors received an award from the ASME's
International Conference on Nuclear Engineering for our work on detection of
Radon using our Tensioned Metastable Fluid Detectors.  The recognition is great
for us, and the application is also very exciting.  Below is a screencapture of
recognition from our College of Engineering.
