In early summer, I received word that I'd received a [2017 Innovation in Nuclear Technology R&D](http://nucleartechinnovations.org/winners2017.html) award for "Students Attending Universities with Less than $600 Million in 2015 Science and Engineering R&D Expenditures".  While that's a mouthful, it was really flattering to be chosen for the award - given by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy.  The award material is really similar to my [ANS Young Member's Group Award]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/work/ans_2016_ymg_award), titled **Detection of Special Nuclear Material in Cargo using Continuous Neutron Interrogation and Tension Metastable Fluid Detectors**, so I'm not going to expound on it here. I'm grateful to the DoE and my coauthors (Dr. Rusi Taleyarkhan and Dr. Brian Archambault) for this award.
