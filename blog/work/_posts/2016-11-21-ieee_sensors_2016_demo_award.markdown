In early November, we received the 1st Place Demo award from the IEEE Sensors
conference, which we had presented at just several weeks before.  It's great to
get recognition, and my contribution to this award was sizeable.  I had
designed and prototyped the DC powered CTMFD unit that we took down to the
conference, and wrote the Android App used to control it.

Obviously, we are proud of the recognition, and usually I like to write up what
we actually presented on.  However, at this conference, the conference
generated a video primer of our demonstration, and I've embedded that below.  I
think it shows more fluently what we like to show than simply writing it up.
