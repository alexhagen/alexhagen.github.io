*To be honest, I'm severly backdating this (I'm writing this in 2017), but I
 think it's okay because all the material was made in 2012-2014 and I'm just
 documenting it at this point.*

One of the big steps towards my doctorate was passing qualification exams.  In
so doing, I generated a lot of material reviewing and extending on my graduate
classes.  I also had some disagreements with the way the faculty members here at
Purdue had treated the qualification exams, both for their ambiguity and
grading.  The faculty were kind and respectful enough to work towards changing
their policies, which is a great sign.

Anyways, I feel that I became a much better engineer for the process I had for
passing qualification exams, and I wanted to share the materials I had created
to help other future students be more directed in their studying.  So, without
too much more commentary, I've posted all the materials
[here](https://alexhagen.github.io/qe/).
