<p>I’ve created a fast analog to digital conversion system using only an Arduino
Yun (and an external computer to process data).  The system can sample the
Arduino Yun’s ADC at 8-bit at greater than 30 kSps and then send those samples
out via UDP at the same rate.  With a fast enough external computer (most modern
computers would be), you can then catch most of those samples without error and
plot them, or log them.</p>
