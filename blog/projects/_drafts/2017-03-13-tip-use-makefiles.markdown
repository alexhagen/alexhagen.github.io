As part of the requirements for my the specialization in *Computational Science
in Engineering*, I had to take a class called "Computer Science for Engineers"
from Purdue's School of Computer science.  I did not like it. It was too
theoretically based, and for the most part did not support "Getting Things Done
with Computers", the classes subtitle.  However, one topic of the class's
endless minutiae has become an integral part of my toolbox as an engineer. That
is the use of ``Makefile``s.

The concept of a ``Makefile`` is simple.  It's a script.  Nothing more and
nothing less. You simply type ``make`` into the folder containing the
``Makefile``, and it does something. Anything.  You can add "targets", which are
just command-line arguments, and it will do other things.  But, you always type
``make``.  And that, while seemingly small, is a huge benefit.

The idea of having one command that works everywhere is an organic one.  It's
the concept that you press the red button to stop.  It's the concept that you
turn a key to turn on a car.  It's even been developed independently with so
many different things.  For example: my colleagues often have to run a script to
start their nuclear transport simulations.  Being Windows guys, they wrote a
batch file that they just copy everywhere.  It's called ``gobaby.bat``, always.
The ability to revisit your own work from years ago, or to drop into someone
else's work and just type ``gobaby``, or in our case, ``make`` is indispensable.

Now that I've waxed philosophical about ``Makefiles``, I'll actually back it up
with some concrete situations and examples that you can use in your own
research.

## Makefiles for Data Provenance

## Makefiles for Organization
