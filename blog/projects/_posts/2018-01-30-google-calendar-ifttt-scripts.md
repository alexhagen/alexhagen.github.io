As many "nerds", I've gotten really into the quantified self movement.
[If-this-then-that](http://ifttt.com) is a great resource for that, letting you
script interactions between different services (that don't necessarily play
nicely on their own: e.g. Amazon and Google, or Apple and anything).
Unfortunately, I'm picky about my data, so I want to be able to change the
time structure or name of these events.  Particularly, I track my work hours
and my sleep, and the event timing for these was 15 minutes coming straight
from IFTTT.  So, below I've written a couple scripts that I can run every
week or so to clean everything up and have it display nicely.  I hope these
help somebody.
