  I guess one thing about a Ph.D., is that, by the end of it, you better be good
  at classes.  Whether that means good at taking classes, good at avoiding
  classes, or good at teaching classes.  I haven't gotten much time to teach
  during my Ph.D., but it's always something I enjoy.  I'm publishing those
  things that might be useful as far as teaching goes.
